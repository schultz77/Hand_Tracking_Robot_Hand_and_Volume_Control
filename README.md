8# Hand_Tracking_Robot_Hand_and_Volume_Control
This repository comprises two scripts:

1. Hand_Tracking_Robot_Hand (robot_arm.py)
This script enables the control of lego motors using buildhat with raspberry pi 4 (bullseye)
for mimicking hand movements. Finger/hand detection was performed by using the library mediapipe. 
Basis for the implementation can be found here: https://github.com/Diwas524/Volume-Control-using-gesture

2. Hand_Tracking_Volume_Control (hand_tracking_vol_ctrl_pulse.py)
This script enables the control the volume of your raspberry pi 4 (bullseye)
using hand gestures. Finger/hand detection was performed by using the library mediapipe. 
Basis for the implementation can be found here: https://github.com/Diwas524/Volume-Control-using-gesture
